                <hr>
                <p>First week of January, we spent our first weekend together. It was fun, but we did not know that something will come that will separate us for some time.<br> <hr></p>
                <p>Second week, she got chickenpox which then led her to missing out school, I had to deliver some medicine so that it can help her. It's been almost a week since we haven't seen each other, I miss her <br><hr></p>
                <p>It's the third week, she's already healed and can go to school now. I can't wait to see her again on Sunday, to add that our Anniversary is also near, I love her so much <br> <hr> </p>
                <p>Thursday of the third week, I visited to see her! I missed hugging my lovelove hehe <br> <hr> </p>
                <p>25th of January, we had our advanced Anniversary Date! I had so much fun, and to top it off, we got a huge stuffed toy in the cutting machine. We named her Minky because he's a Pink(Mink) Monkey hehe <br> <hr></p>

                <p>First week of February, we had lots of fun hanging out! Our main dish for this week is potato hehe <br> <hr></p>
                <p>Valentine's near, as I am typing this, it's already night time and in my phone. It may be hard but if it's for her then I'll do it. Tomorrow I'll give her my gift and hope she likes it very much hehe <br> <hr></p>
                <p>Valentine's done, we hanged out together last Sunday and we had fun, although we fought for a moment but we made up immediately. Now I am planning on how I am going to add a database to this website to further improve the experience<br> <hr></p>
